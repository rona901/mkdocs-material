# Getting started

Material for MkDocs is a powerful documentation framework on top of [MkDocs],
a static site generator for project documentation.[^1] If you're familiar with
Python, you can install Material for MkDocs with [`pip`][pip], the Python
package manager. If not, we recommend using [`docker`][docker].

  [^1]:
    In 2016, Material for MkDocs started out as a simple theme for MkDocs, but
    over the course of several years, it's now much more than that – with the
    many built-in plugins, settings, and countless customization abilities,
    Material for MkDocs is now one of the simplest and most powerful frameworks
    for creating documentation for your project.

  [docker]: #with-docker

## Installation

### with pip <small>recommended</small> { #with-pip data-toc-label="with pip" }

Material for MkDocs is published as a [Python package] and can be installed with
`pip`, ideally by using a [virtual environment]. Open up a terminal and install
Material for MkDocs with:

=== "Latest"

    ``` sh
    pip install mkdocs-material
    ```

=== "9.x"

    ``` sh
    pip install mkdocs-material=="9.*" # (1)!
    ```

    1.  Material for MkDocs uses [semantic versioning][^2], which is why it's a
        good idea to limit upgrades to the current major version.

        This will make sure that you don't accidentally [upgrade to the next
        major version], which may include breaking changes that silently corrupt
        your site. Additionally, you can use `pip freeze` to create a lockfile,
        so builds are reproducible at all times:

        ```
        pip freeze > requirements.txt
        ```

        Now, the lockfile can be used for installation:

        ```
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

  [^2]:
    Note that improvements of existing features are sometimes released as
    patch releases, like for example improved rendering of content tabs, as
    they're not considered to be new features.

This will automatically install compatible versions of all dependencies:
[MkDocs], [Markdown], [Pygments] and [Python Markdown Extensions]. Material for
MkDocs always strives to support the latest versions, so there's no need to
install those packages separately.
